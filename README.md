# Capstone-Tiktok-Project
Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone Portfolio Project on Tiktok


TikTok users have the ability to report videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. This process generates a large number of user reports that are difficult to address quickly.

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.
